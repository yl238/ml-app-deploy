    "## Wrapping a C library in Python with ctypes\n",
    "Wrapping a C library in Python allows us to leverage existing C code or to implement a critical part of the code in a fast language such as C.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is relatively easy to use externally compiled library with Python. The first possibility is to call a commandline executable with an `os.system` command, but this method does not extend to compiled libraries. A more powerful method consists of using a native Python module called **ctypes**. This module allows us to call functions defined in a compiled library (written in C) from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ctypes` module takes care of the data type conversions between C and Python. In addition, the `numpy.ctypeslib` module provides facilities to use NumPy arrays whenever data buffers are used in the external library."
