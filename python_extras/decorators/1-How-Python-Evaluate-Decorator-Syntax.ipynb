    "# How Python evaluates decorator syntax\n",
    "A decorator is a callable that takes another function as argument (the decorated function). The decorator may perform some processing with the decorated function, and returns it or replaces it with another function or callable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, assuming an existing decorator named `decorate`, this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@decorate\n",
    "def target():\n",
    "    print('running target()')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Has the same effect as writing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def target():\n",
    "    print('running target()')\n",
    "target = decorate(target)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of either of these snippets, the `target` name does not necessarily refer to the original `target` function, but to whatever function is returned by `decorate(target)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, decorators are just syntactic sugar."
