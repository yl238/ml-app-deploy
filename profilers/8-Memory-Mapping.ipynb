    "## Processing large NumPy arrays with memory mapping\n",
    "When NumPy arrays are too big to fit in the system memory. A common solution is to use **memory mapping** and implement **out-of-core computations**. The array is stored in a file on the hard drive, and we create a memory-mapped object to this file that can be used as regular NumPy array. Accessing a portion of the array results in the corresponding data being automatically fetched from the hard drive. Therefore, we only consume what we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works...\n",
    "Memory mapping lets you work with huge arrays almost as if they were regular arrays. Python code that accepts a NumPy array as input will also accept a `memmap` array. However, we need to ensure that the array is used efficiently. That is, the array is never loaded as a whole (otherwise, it would waste system memory and would obviate any advantage of the technique).\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory mapping is also useful when you have a huge file containing raw data in a homogeneous binary format with a known data type and shape. In this case, an alternative solution is to use NumPy's `fromfile()` function with a file handle created with Python's native `open()` function. Using `f.seek()` lets you position the cursor at any location and load a given number of bytes into a NumPy array. "
